## Get Start
  First, you need to follow the [w3bstream](https://github.com/iotexproject/w3bstream) tutorial to start a docker container locally.
  You need to add your private key to the configuration file before packaging the image in `cmd/srv-applet-mgr/config/local.yml `
  
  `local.yml`
  
  ```yml
  SRV_APPLET_MGR__ETHCLIENTCONFIG__PrivateKey: <YOUR PRIVATE KEY>
  ```

  After you start the mirror locally, the preparatory work can be completed. Here are the detailed tutorials for each project.
